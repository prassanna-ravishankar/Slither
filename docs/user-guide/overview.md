# Overview

Slither is a unique Random Forest implementation that combines ensemble learning with Support Vector Machine (SVM) local experts at tree nodes. This design makes it particularly effective for computer vision and high-dimensional classification tasks.

## What Makes Slither Different?

### Traditional Random Forest

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root Node] --> B{feature[i] < 0.5?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Left Subtree]
    B -->|No| D[Right Subtree]
    C --> E[Leaf: Class 0]
    D --> F[Leaf: Class 1]
```

**Decision Rule**: Simple threshold comparison  
**Complexity**: Linear decision boundaries  
**Training**: Fast threshold optimization  

### Slither Random Forest

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root Node] --> B[SVM Classifier]
    B --> C{SVM Decision}
    C -->|Class 0| D[Left Subtree]
    C -->|Class 1| E[Right Subtree]
    D --> F[SVM Classifier]
    E --> G[SVM Classifier]
    F --> H[Leaf: Predictions]
    G --> I[Leaf: Predictions]
```

**Decision Rule**: SVM classification at each node  
**Complexity**: Non-linear decision boundaries  
**Training**: SVM optimization at each split  

## Architecture Overview

### Forest Structure

```python
Forest
├── Tree 1
│   ├── Node 0 (Root): SVM Classifier
│   ├── Node 1: SVM Classifier  
│   ├── Node 2: SVM Classifier
│   └── ...
├── Tree 2
│   ├── Node 0 (Root): SVM Classifier
│   └── ...
└── Tree N
    └── ...
```

### Node Components

Each tree node contains:

1. **SVM Classifier**: Linear or non-linear decision function
2. **Training Statistics**: Class distributions and sample counts
3. **Split Criterion**: Information gain based splitting
4. **Child Pointers**: References to left and right subtrees

### Training Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant F as Forest Trainer
    participant T as Tree Trainer
    participant N as Node Trainer
    participant S as SVM

    F->>T: Train Tree(data, params)
    T->>N: Train Node(subset, depth)
    N->>S: Optimize SVM(features, labels)
    S-->>N: Return decision function
    N-->>T: Split data based on SVM
    T->>N: Train children recursively
    T-->>F: Return trained tree
    F->>F: Repeat for N trees
```

## Algorithm Details

### Tree Construction

1. **Root Node Creation**
   ```python
   # Select random feature subset
   candidate_features = random_sample(all_features, n_candidate_features)
   
   # Train SVM with selected features
   svm = train_svm(data[candidate_features], labels, svm_c)
   
   # Split data based on SVM predictions
   left_data, right_data = split_by_svm(data, svm)
   ```

2. **Recursive Splitting**
   ```python
   # Calculate information gain
   gain = information_gain(parent_entropy, left_entropy, right_entropy)
   
   if gain > min_gain and depth < max_depth:
       # Continue splitting
       left_child = train_node(left_data, depth + 1)
       right_child = train_node(right_data, depth + 1)
   else:
       # Create leaf node
       return create_leaf(class_distribution)
   ```

3. **Stopping Criteria**
   - Maximum depth reached
   - Minimum samples per node
   - No information gain improvement
   - Pure node (single class)

### Prediction Process

```python
def predict_sample(sample, tree):
    node = tree.root
    
    while not node.is_leaf():
        # Use SVM to decide direction
        if node.svm.predict(sample) == 0:
            node = node.left_child
        else:
            node = node.right_child
    
    return node.class_probabilities

# Ensemble prediction
def predict_forest(sample, forest):
    predictions = []
    for tree in forest.trees:
        pred = predict_sample(sample, tree)
        predictions.append(pred)
    
    # Average probabilities across trees
    return np.mean(predictions, axis=0)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity

| Operation | Traditional RF | Slither RF |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Training** | O(n × m × log n × k) | O(n × m × s × k) |
| **Prediction** | O(log n × k) | O(log n × m × k) |
| **Memory** | O(n × k) | O(n × m × s × k) |

Where:
- n = number of samples
- m = number of features  
- k = number of trees
- s = SVM training complexity

### Scaling Properties

```python
# Time complexity factors
training_time = (
    n_samples * 
    n_features * 
    svm_complexity * 
    n_trees * 
    tree_depth
)

# Memory usage factors  
memory_usage = (
    n_trees *
    n_nodes_per_tree *
    svm_model_size
)
```
